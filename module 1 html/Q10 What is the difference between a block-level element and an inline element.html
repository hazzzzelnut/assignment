<!-- What is the difference between a block-level element and an inline element?

block-level element.: A block-level element is drawn as a block that stretches to fill the full width available to it i.e, the width of its container and will always start on a new line.
Elements that are block-level by default: <div>, <img>, <section>, <form>, <nav>.

 inline element.: Inline elements are drawn where they are defined and only take up space that is absolutely needed. The easiest way to understand how they work is to look at how text flows on a page.
Examples of elements that are inline by default: <span>, <b>, <strong>, <a>, <input>.
