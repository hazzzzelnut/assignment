<!-- Are the HTML tags and elements the same thing? 
    
    Tags and Elements are not the same.


    Element: They are the pieces themselves, i.e. a paragraph is an element, or a header is an element, even the body is an element.

    Tags: are not the elements themselves, rather they're the bits of text you use to tell the computer where an element begins and ends. It starts between < and >.
