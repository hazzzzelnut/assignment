<!-- What is the difference between CSS2 and CSS3 

CSS: CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheet. Its main objective is to provide styling and fashion to the web page. CSS provides color, layout, background, font, and border properties. CSS features allow better content accessibility, enhanced flexibility, and control, as well as the specification of the characteristics of presentation.

CSS3: CSS3 stands for Cascading Style Sheet level 3, which is the advanced version of CSS. It is used for structuring, styling, and formatting web pages. Several new features have been added to CSS3 and it is supported by all modern web browsers. The most important feature of CSS3 is the splitting of CSS standards into separate modules that are simpler to learn and use.
